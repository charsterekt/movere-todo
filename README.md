# React Native TODO App <br>

<b>Movere</b> is the Latin word for Motivation, which is the name i've chosen for this app. It was created using a default TypeScript-React Native template. The app was bundled, packaged, served, managed, and prototyped using the Expo platform. The app was developed with Android in mind, and has not been packaged for IOS, although it would certainly be compatible if one chose to do so. The app itself has a simple but clean and minimalistic UI and features a few helper libraries like Native Base for the UI components, and React Native Reanimated, Moti, Drawer and a few others for the appealing animations applied to the components. The user can also switch between dark and light mode as per their preference. The basic CRUD operations are all present and tested. Inspired by yt/devaslife.<br>

## Drawbacks: <br>

The major drawback with the app is the lack of persistent state or local storage. This means all your existing tasks are replaced when you close and relaunch the app. This is a feature left open for future improvement.
